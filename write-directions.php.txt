Gear/Publish
This command is used to set direction icons for each picture in your diary's episode before you upload it to the web server. 
It will scan the .ruehcram/data dir and for each media element, such as video or text file, display it using the system default application, and will prompt you for a text or html comment that will be inserted juste before it. Empty line means no text content.
